When the shop assistant gives me the wrong change, I offer to recalculate.
When someone tell me that I made a mistake, I analyze the situation.
When my dog barks loudly at night, I get up and remember that I don't have a dog.
When I have a bad cough, I ignore it.
When my car has a little petrol, I drive to Shell.
When I forget my shopping list and what to buy, I just buy ice cream.
When I leave for work and starts raining, I order a taxi.
When my boss asks me to work overtime, I work overtime.

If I forget that the chicken is cooked in the oven, I will get a big gas bill.
If I lose my house key, I will go find it.

If I late for work, I will work sometime after shift.
If I miss my bus, I will wait for the next bus.
If I fail my driving test, I will learn the necessary rules.
If I do not pay the bills, I will pay next mounth.
